[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/tendies/Celery/_apis/build/status/jedieaston.celery)](https://dev.azure.com/tendies/Celery/_build/latest?definitionId=3)
# celery
A sign in/sign out system, written in Python 3 + Flask

# Setup

Just run "pipenv install" for the master branch, or build the dockerfile. requirements.txt should be up to date.

config/settings.yaml is generated on first run (and if it gets deleted), and that is where you have to set database settings.
Everything else can be changed in the admin settings editor.
